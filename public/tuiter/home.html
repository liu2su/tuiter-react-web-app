            "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and
            I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
            the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to
            obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
            pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
            physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a
            man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
            produces no resultant pleasure?"

            "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
            demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the
            pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
            weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are
            perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
            nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain
            avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it
            will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
            always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
            pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
